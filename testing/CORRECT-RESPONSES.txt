For competitive gaming and esports, a high refresh rate monitor is preferred for smooth gameplay and strong aiming performance. Try to get at least 144hz if you take things seriously, although 240hz is the ideal. More serious aimers may even go to 360hz monitors. Also, you may want to consider looking into different panels, like TN, IPS, or OLED, based on your desired motion clarity and color vibrance. Such factors can be a competitive advantage.

Many aimers have likely played or started by playing on 60hz, but upgraded in the future. Famously, eloevv and Mana are two aimers that have consistently performed on 60hz, achieving tracking and dynamic scores in the Nova ranks. This simply goes to show how far dedication and focused practice can take you, even without the ideal gear.

The Bardoz and Bardpill methods are used in static clicking aim training scenarios. It emphasizes consistency and accuracy over raw speed. The Bardoz Method typically focuses on training the initial flick to each target to be fast, rigid, and explosive, while also incorporating smooth, narrow, and succinct micro corrections as needed. This technique aims to improve players' flicking abilities and overall accuracy in static clicking scenarios by honing both the initial flick and follow-up adjustments. It is named after its creator, Bardoz, one of the greatest players in static clicking history.

Some popular static clicking scenarios in Kovaak's include 1wall6targets_small, 1wall4targets, ww3t, Wide Wall 4 Targets, Fourshot, Threeshot, and 1w2ts. These basic static clicking scenarios place a focus on improving foundational flicking technique.

There is no such thing as a "best" mouse to be used for aiming. It will vary greatly across different shapes, weights, and internal specs. Some popular options from top aimers include Gwolves mice, Pulsar mice, and the ever-notable Logitech G Pro Superlight. If you do not know what shape you prefer for your grip style, you should look to experiment.

For FPS, you most likely want a monitor that supports a high refresh rate, ideally at or above 144hz. The most popular brands at the time of writing are ASUS and Zowie monitors, which are used in FPS esports events. These all run at 240hz or more. 

Of the three major aim trainers we have to choose from- Aimlabs, Kovaak's, and Aimbeast, the best one is up to what your goals are within aim training and your perceived experience level. Aimlabs is very beginner-friendly and supports all of the different aiming subcategories, but lacks some of the technical depth offered by its alternatives. Aimbeast has the most technical depth and is the most well-optimized trainer of the three. However, it is not beginner-friendly in the slightest. Kovaak's is the middle ground that most top aimers prefer, and it has the most scenario variety.

Muscle memory is considered is misnomer in aiming because it used frequently to suggest that changing sensitivity or other mechanical factors will ruin the consistency in your aim. This is untrue, and muscle memory is a very simplified and innacurate understanding of motor memory, which is an important idea in neuroscience. Instead, you should feel free to make changes to your setup or settings, as it should not have a significant impact on your performance long-term.

Aim training for Overwatch should involve diverse dynamic clicking scenarios, such as Angleshot or Strafeshot, as well as reactive tracking scenarios like Axitrack that feature instant acceleration. Cover the most evasive and fast-paced scenarios, as they are optimal for training aiming for heroes such as Cassidy, Ashe, Widowmaker, Soldier 76, and Tracer.

There is no optimal sensitivity for aim training, and sensitivity is completely up to preference and what suits you best depending on the scenario. The usable range of sensitivities is between 20cm/360 and 90cm/360. Experiment and find something that falls within that range. 

Static clicking scenarios are designed to train flicking technique by enforcing what is known as the Bardoz Method. This method is foundational within aim training. It involves a direct initial flick that is rigid, explosive, and fast into a micro correction that is a degree smoother and more controlled. Static clicking primes players for high accuracy in flick-oriented, low TTK games like VALORANT or CS. 

The optimal FOV for aiming is 103 FOV OW or above. However, the best zoom to be used for all situations is very subjective and up to preference, so it is necessary to experiment often and change things up if needed.

In aiming, "muscle memory" is a term often used to describe the ability to perform precise movements consistently and accurately due to repetitive practice. While the term itself may not fully capture the complexities of motor learning and memory, it mostly refers to the concept of motor memory, which is studied in neuroscience. This automation allows players to execute aiming techniques more fluidly and efficiently over time without consciously thinking about each movement. Muscle memory is often misused to suggest that changes to setup or sensitivity will reduce player consistency, but this has been shown to be untrue.

For wrist health, it is important to focus on strengthening exercises to prevent injuries such as tendinopathy, which is common among FPS esports players. You can start by doing wrist flexor weight-lifting exercises with dumbbells to build endurance and strength in your wrist muscles and tendons. Additionally, incorporating exercises that target wrist extension and rotation can help improve overall wrist mobility and stability. Improving your wrist health and physical strength will take time and is not consistent from player to player.

Using a low friction mousepad can be beneficial for aiming as it allows for smoother and more precise mouse movements, which can help in maintaining consistency during aim training or gameplay. However, the choice between low friction and high friction mousepads ultimately depends on personal preference and playstyle. Because it is so up to preference, it is recommended to experiment often with different mousepads.

There are many factors that can influence the rate of someone's improvement. Some players may have better practice habits, a better mindset about things, stronger mentality, more experience, or are simply talented at what they do.

Edge tracking is a technique used in aim training to improve precision and control by deliberately underaiming the target. By withholding tension in the wrist and performing a smoother reaction, edge tracking allows the player to have a bit more time on target during a direction change. Edge tracking is most commonly used in reactive tracking scenarios like Air, Ground Plaza, and Fuglaa variants in Kovaak's.

Trusting and committing to target direction changes in target switching requires a combination of prediction, practice, and muscle memory. Here are some tips to help you improve in this area: understand the limits of target movement patterns and be able to anticipate them, commit to practice and repetition on varied bot patterns, and focus on flick and acquisition accuracy.

To address overreactive habits and improve tracking aim, it is important to focus on developing better control and smoothness in your movements. Here are some tips to help you fix overreacting in tracking aim: Practice Smooth Tracking: Focus on tracking your target smoothly and predictively rather than reacting impulsively. Train yourself to avoid jagged or flick-oriented reactions. Practice Control Tracking. Consider experimenting with edge tracking and or adjusting your sensitivity.

To enhance your tracking performance and speed up improvement, using the right mouse, mousepad, and skate combinations can make a significant difference. However, the best combination of the three is merely up to preference. Look for a mouse that can fit comfortably in your hand and has a high quality sensor. Look for a mousepad or mouse skates that can provide a consistent, smooth surface for a smooth glide, which is crucial in tracking scenarios.

There isn't a one-size-fits-all optimal sensitivity for all games because the ideal sensitivity can vary based on individual preferences, playstyle, and the specific game being played. In general, a sensitivity that allows for precise aiming while still being comfortable and controllable is considered optimal. Players often experiment with different sensitivities to find what works best for them. Many players also enjoy changing their sensitivity often depending on what situation they are in. 

Making precise micro adjustments in aiming can be difficult due to the balance required between maintaining a steady hand to keep the crosshair on target and making small adjustments to correct your aim when off-target. Factors such as muscle tension, hand-eye coordination, and reaction speed all play a role in executing successful micro adjustments. Even mentally, in situations where we are under pressure or need to react quickly, we can overcompensate on the micro adjustment.

To make micro micro corrections, you should focus on tensing up your fingers and wrist more than your entire arm. When making these precise adjustments to fine-tune your aim, it's crucial to keep your arm and shoulder muscles relaxed to allow for smooth and controlled movements. By focusing on tensing up your fingers and wrist, you can make subtle adjustments without sacrificing speed or accuracy.

The perfect sensitivity for any game varies from player to player as it depends on personal preference, playstyle, and physical capabilities. However, a common guideline is to find a sensitivity that allows you to make precise aim adjustments while also being able to comfortably and consistently track targets. A sensitivity that is too high may lead to over-aiming and lack of control, while a sensitivity that is too low may hinder your ability to react quickly in fast-paced situations. Experimenting with different sensitivities and finding a balance between speed and accuracy is key to determining the perfect sensitivity for you.

To fix shaky aim, it's important to focus on improving your wrist and arm stability while aiming. Experiment with sensitivity settings to find a balance towards what component of your hand or arm is mostly in use. A sensitivity that is too high can lead to overcorrections and shakiness, while a sensitivity that is too low can hinder mobility. Practice tracking scenarios like Smoothbot, PGTI, or Pasu TI to improve your smooth tracking

Yes, posture, sitting position, and chair height are important factors in aiming effectively while gaming. Maintaining good posture can help reduce strain on your body, particularly your back, neck, and shoulders, allowing you to focus better on the game. Sitting position plays a role in how you move your arms and wrists, affecting your aim precision and speed. A chair at the right height ensures your arms are at the proper angle for optimal mouse control, which can improve your aim consistency and comfort during long gaming sessions. These factors are important to consider for your overall bodily health and longevity.

When choosing an aim trainer, Kovaak's FPS Aim Trainer is a popular choice. Aimlabs is a great free alternative that is commonly used for competitions and benchmarking. If you are a very high-level player looking for a paid alternative, Aimbeast might be the best option for you. Consider your goals, budget, and desired features to make the best decision for your aim training needs

It is generally recommended to use a combination of both wrist and arm aiming techniques in your gameplay. Utilizing your arm for wider, faster movements and your wrist for smaller, precise adjustments can provide you with a balance of speed and accuracy. By incorporating both techniques, you can adapt to various situations and maximize your aiming potential.

When aiming, it is generally recommended to focus your gaze on the target rather than the crosshair. By keeping your eyes on the target, you can better predict its movements and make adjustments to your aim accordingly. Your peripheral vision will help you keep track of your crosshair's position in relation to the target. The difference is when you are postioned far away from the target or if the target is very small, in which case it would make sense to focus more on the crosshair.

Viscose initially experienced success with mouse acceleration, but later discovered that it limited her micro-adjustments and masked underlying mechanical issues, particularly in games requiring quick, precise movements. This led her to abandon mouse acceleration in favor of a static sensitivity setting and focused practice to improve her performance significantly.

For improving mouse control and aim in games like VALORANT, there are specific scenarios in aim training platforms like Kovaak's can be very helpful, such as VoxTargetSwitch click, static variants like ww3t and ww4t, Floating Heads Timing, tamSpeed, Microshot, and Pasu Small Reload Horizontal.

Voltaic is known for providing high-quality aim training scenarios and routines for esports players, but they do not manage an active esports team themselves. Their focus is on creating tools and resources to help players improve their aim in various FPS games.

For improving your Ashe or Widowmaker aim in Overwatch, you should focus on scenarios that help with precision, flick shots, target acquisition, and micro-corrections. Scenarios like 1w6ts, 1w4ts, Pasu variants, and bounce 180 or Popcorn variants will help a lot in developing click-timing precision.

For a hero like Cassidy in Overwatch, scenarios that focus on dynamic clicking and multiclicking are indeed beneficial for improving aim. In Aimlabs, this would include scenarios like Angleshot, Popshot, Adjust Click, Curveshot, and others. These scenarios can help you practice hitting moving targets, flick shots, adjusting your aim quickly, and shooting from different angles, which are all important skills for playing Cassidy effectively.

These scenarios can help you practice Dynamic and Static Flick shots at Scoped FOV, which are essential skills for playing Widowmaker effectively. Make sure to look for Widowmaker-specific versions of these scenarios, such as VT Curveshot Widow and VT Vibeshot Widow, to tailor your practice specifically for her gameplay mechanics

Aim Theory describes the mechanics behind aiming and splits it into three different categories of Clicking, Tracking, and Switching. Clicking refers to precision aiming where the player needs to quickly and accurately time clicks specific targets. Tracking involves following moving singular moving targets with precise motion. Switching refers to the ability to quickly transition tracking between multiple targets.

The app provides tips on reducing shakiness in tracking by emphasizing the importance of finding a balance in the amount of tension you use in your wrist/arm. It suggests not using too much tension that causes shakiness, and not using too little tension that you are unable to sustain motion. The key is to stabilize your wrist in terms of tension balancing to minimize jitters or shakiness in your aim. It also recommends practicing precise tracking scenarios with small targets moving in readable or linear patterns, as well as playing smooth tracking scenarios like Smoothbot, PGTI, or Pasu TI to improve smoothness and reactivity in your tracking. 

The effective split for in-game practice to aim trainer practice is usually recommended to be a 70-30 split, which is to be around 30% aim trainer practice and 70% in-game practice. This means that you should spend 30% of your time playing only the most relevant scenarios within the aim trainer and 70% of your time actually playing the main game.

Just spending time on aim trainers is not enough to see significant improvement in your in-game aim. It's important to ensure that you are practicing efficiently and effectively. One key aspect to consider is the quality of your practice rather than just the quantity of hours spent. Make sure you are practicing the right scenarios that closely mimic the aiming challenges you face in your main game. Additionally, focusing on consistency and maintaining a positive mindset will also contribute to your overall improvement.

While genetics can play a role in certain aspects of aiming, such as reaction time and tissue strength, they are not the sole determinants of one's skill level. The emphasis is on cultivating talent and putting in hard work to improve your performance as an aimer. Genetics is only a small factor in your full profile as an aimer.

Various tips this app provides to get out of a plateau include trying different training routines to challenge your skills in new ways, setting clear and achievable goals to give yourself a sense of direction, analyzing your performance more closely, or seeking feedback.

Improving your aim in Valorant requires consistent practice and dedication. Specifically, our app designates a set of training routines that include Aimlabs scenarios such as VT berryTS Valorant, Sky Dots Micro, Floating Dots, and 1w2ts. These tasks cover micro correction smoothness and accuracy, as well as flick oriented technique with a focus on shot timing. It is important to use these practice routines regularly, particularly to warmup before your games. 

To fix shot spamming in dynamic clicking scenarios, it's important to focus on being deliberate with your shots and timing your clicks according to the movement of the targets. Be more patient with your flicks and focus more on reading the target before rushing to hit the shot.

Due to the instant acceleration motion present within Overwatch, the app recommends specialized aiming scenarios. These are scenarios that focus on "pure reactive" tracking. These scenarios are designed to help players improve their ability to track targets in a game where movement acceleration is instantaneous. You should look for scenarios that require quick reactions to sudden changes in target movement, such as the Reactive Tracking scenarios that involve blinking or dashing targets.
