For competitive gaming and esports, a high refresh rate monitor is preferred for smooth gameplay and strong aiming performance. Try to get at least 144hz if you take things seriously, although 240hz is the ideal. More serious aimers may even go to 360hz monitors. Also, you may want to consider looking into different panels, like TN, IPS, or OLED, based on your desired motion clarity and color vibrance. Such factors can be a competitive advantage.

Many aimers have likely played or started by playing on 60hz, but upgraded in the future. Famously, eloevv and Mana are two aimers that have consistently performed on 60hz, achieving tracking and dynamic scores in the Nova ranks. This simply goes to show how far dedication and focused practice can take you, even without the ideal gear.

The Bardoz and Bardpill methods are used in static clicking aim training scenarios. It emphasizes consistency and accuracy over raw speed. The Bardoz Method typically focuses on training the initial flick to each target to be fast, rigid, and explosive, while also incorporating smooth, narrow, and succinct micro corrections as needed. This technique aims to improve players' flicking abilities and overall accuracy in static clicking scenarios by honing both the initial flick and follow-up adjustments. It is named after its creator, Bardoz, one of the greatest players in static clicking history.
