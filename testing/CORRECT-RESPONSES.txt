For competitive gaming and esports, a high refresh rate monitor is preferred for smooth gameplay and strong aiming performance. Try to get at least 144hz if you take things seriously, although 240hz is the ideal. More serious aimers may even go to 360hz monitors. Also, you may want to consider looking into different panels, like TN, IPS, or OLED, based on your desired motion clarity and color vibrance. Such factors can be a competitive advantage.

Many aimers have likely played or started by playing on 60hz, but upgraded in the future. Famously, eloevv and Mana are two aimers that have consistently performed on 60hz, achieving tracking and dynamic scores in the Nova ranks. This simply goes to show how far dedication and focused practice can take you, even without the ideal gear.

The Bardoz and Bardpill methods are used in static clicking aim training scenarios. It emphasizes consistency and accuracy over raw speed. The Bardoz Method typically focuses on training the initial flick to each target to be fast, rigid, and explosive, while also incorporating smooth, narrow, and succinct micro corrections as needed. This technique aims to improve players' flicking abilities and overall accuracy in static clicking scenarios by honing both the initial flick and follow-up adjustments. It is named after its creator, Bardoz, one of the greatest players in static clicking history.

Some popular static clicking scenarios in Kovaak's include 1wall6targets_small, 1wall4targets, ww3t, Wide Wall 4 Targets, Fourshot, Threeshot, and 1w2ts. These basic static clicking scenarios place a focus on improving foundational flicking technique.

There is no such thing as a "best" mouse to be used for aiming. It will vary greatly across different shapes, weights, and internal specs. Some popular options from top aimers include Gwolves mice, Pulsar mice, and the ever-notable Logitech G Pro Superlight. If you do not know what shape you prefer for your grip style, you should look to experiment.

For FPS, you most likely want a monitor that supports a high refresh rate, ideally at or above 144hz. The most popular brands at the time of writing are ASUS and Zowie monitors, which are used in FPS esports events. These all run at 240hz or more. 

Of the three major aim trainers we have to choose from- Aimlabs, Kovaak's, and Aimbeast, the best one is up to what your goals are within aim training and your perceived experience level. Aimlabs is very beginner-friendly and supports all of the different aiming subcategories, but lacks some of the technical depth offered by its alternatives. Aimbeast has the most technical depth and is the most well-optimized trainer of the three. However, it is not beginner-friendly in the slightest. Kovaak's is the middle ground that most top aimers prefer, and it has the most scenario variety.

Muscle memory is considered is misnomer in aiming because it used frequently to suggest that changing sensitivity or other mechanical factors will ruin the consistency in your aim. This is untrue, and muscle memory is a very simplified and innacurate understanding of motor memory, which is an important idea in neuroscience. Instead, you should feel free to make changes to your setup or settings, as it should not have a significant impact on your performance long-term.

Aim training for Overwatch should involve diverse dynamic clicking scenarios, such as Angleshot or Strafeshot, as well as reactive tracking scenarios like Axitrack that feature instant acceleration. Cover the most evasive and fast-paced scenarios, as they are optimal for training aiming for heroes such as Cassidy, Ashe, Widowmaker, Soldier 76, and Tracer.

There is no optimal sensitivity for aim training, and sensitivity is completely up to preference and what suits you best depending on the scenario. The usable range of sensitivities is between 20cm/360 and 90cm/360. Experiment and find something that falls within that range. 

Static clicking scenarios are designed to train flicking technique by enforcing what is known as the Bardoz Method. This method is foundational within aim training. It involves a direct initial flick that is rigid, explosive, and fast into a micro correction that is a degree smoother and more controlled. Static clicking primes players for high accuracy in flick-oriented, low TTK games like VALORANT or CS.
