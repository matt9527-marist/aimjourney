  "In Congress, July 4, 1776\nThe unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of\nhuman events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have\nconnected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and\nequal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to\nthe opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the\nseparation.",
  "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed\nby their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the\npursuit of Happiness.",
  "--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,\nderiving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of\nGovernment becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to\nabolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and\norganizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to e�ect their Safety and\nHappiness.",
  "Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be\nchanged for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that\nmankind are more disposed to su�er, while evils are su�erable, than to right themselves by\nabolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.",
  "But when a long train of abuses and\nusurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under\nabsolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw o� such Government, and to\nprovide new Guards for their future security.",
  "--Such has been the patient su�erance of these\nDeclaration of Independence: A Transcription | National Archiveshttps://www. archives.",
  "Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of\nGovernment. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and\nusurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these\nStates.",
  "To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.",
  "He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless\nsuspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he\nhas utterly neglected to attend to them.",
  "He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless\nthose people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right\ninestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.",
  "He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from\nthe depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance\nwith his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his\ninvasions on the rights of the people.",
  "He has refused for a long time, a�er such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby\nthe Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for\ntheir exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion\nfrom without, and convulsions within.",
  "He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing\nthe Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their\nmigrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.",
  "He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for\nestablishing Judiciary powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their o�ices, and the\namount and payment of their salaries.",
  "He has erected a multitude of New O�ices, and sent hither swarms of O�icers to harrass our\npeople, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our\nlegislatures.",
  "He has a�ected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and\nDeclaration of Independence: A Transcription | National Archiveshttps://www. archives.",

  "unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should\ncommit on the Inhabitants of these States:\nFor cutting o� our Trade with all parts of the world:\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended o�ences\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing\ntherein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an\nexample and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally\nthe Forms of our Governments:\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to\nlegislate for us in all cases whatsoever.",
  "He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War\nagainst us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of\nour people.",
  "He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of\ndeath, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy\nscarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized\nnation.",
  "He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against\ntheir Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves\nby their Hands.",
  "He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the\ninhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an\nundistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.",
  "In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms:\nOur repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury.",
  "A Prince whose character is\nthus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Declaration of Independence: A Transcription | National Archiveshttps://www. archives.",
  "Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from\ntime to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We\nhave reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.",
  "We have\nappealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our\ncommon kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our\nconnections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of\nconsanguinity.",
  "We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our\nSeparation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.",
  "We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress,\nAssembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do,\nin the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and\ndeclare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States;\nthat they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection\nbetween them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as\nFree and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract\nAlliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States\nmay of right do.",
  "And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of\ndivine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred\nHonor.",
